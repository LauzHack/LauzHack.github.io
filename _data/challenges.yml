    Identifying suspicious clients from abnormal behaviors, fraudulent activities or terrorist financing is a major challenge in Compliance at Credit Suisse.  
    Nowadays, rule based scenarios are not anymore relevant and data science is seen as a game changer for the bank. In a world where there are more and more regulations and where the reputational risk is more and more at stake for Credit Suisse, we need you to find out the methods for the future and help us identify our suspicious clients using state of the art machine learning techniques and your smart analysis.  
    You will be given a set of clients with a list of features regarding their profiles and activity with the bank such as total transaction amounts during the year, or the age of the client. You will then have to derive a list of suspicious clients to investigate for the financial crime compliance team - taking also into account not only the features but also regulators rules.  
    The submission will be evaluated both on the algorithmic approach, the scoring results and the novelty in visualizing the data and the model results.

    Improve a public transport network based on data!  
    People have been using public transport with FAIRTIQ for a while now. Could the average commute time have been shorter?  
    Are there public transport lines the could be created/removed to reduce the commute time?  
    Would it be interesting to merge two public transport lines?  
    Or make one shorter? or longer?  
    These are the type of questions you have to ask to yourself in order to optimise the public transport network for Frimobil (Switzerland). In addition to data publicly available (timetable, routes, stations, tariffs) you will get anonymised travel data from FAIRTIQ.  
    Modifications come at a cost, which you'll have to take into consideration.  
    The goal of this challenge is to come up with realistic modifications to apply to the network so that it performs better regarding the criteria explained before.
