# Questions, answers, and an optional 'id' field for hyperlinks (e.g. if you need to show a specific answer to someone).
# The last question is automatically added with the contact information.
# Beware, YAML/Markdown syntax is a bit tricky:
# - Use the weird |- syntax to allow answers to span lines.
# - End lines with two spaces if you want to force a line break, otherwise the line break is ignored.

        That's fine! Hackathons are about writing basic code that glues together existing modules,
