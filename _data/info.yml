  LauzHack is a student-run hackathon at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland.

  Hackathons are creativity and prototyping marathons, in which you "hack" a demo of your cool idea to show its potential.  
  No need to be a programming master, only to be able to glue together existing libraries and interfaces to create your demo as a team.

  Come have fun, meet new friends, and maybe even win prizes during an amazing weekend!
